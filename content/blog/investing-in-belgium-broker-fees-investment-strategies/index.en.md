## Active investing

Active investing is when an investor analyses the stock market on a regular basis and selects securities for their portfolio with the goal of beating an index, such as the S&P 500 or BEL 20. Active investing is generally coupled with _timing the market_ which means the investor attempts to figure out the best time to buy and sell securities, and does so often. Ideally, this means buying when the price is low and selling when the price is high.

Successful active investing or successfully timing the market is a lot easier said than done. I linked [this](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2022.pdf) research in the previous post as well. **One of the key takeaways from that article is that over a 20-year period, 92% of US funds don't manage to beat the S&P Composite 1500, an index that covers 90% of the US stock market**. Keep in mind that these funds are run by fund managers, who are by definition active investors as it's their job to outperform an index.

What this tells me is that it isn't worth investing actively managed fund as the chances are high that it won't outperform the market. It also tells me investing time and money in selecting stocks for my own portfolio probably isn't going to work as fund managers, which literally do that as a job, aren't able to do it successfully the majority of the time.

I encourage you to do your own research on index funds and active investing because there are many conflicting opinions on those topics.

## Passive investing

Passive investing is when an investor invests in a _diversified_ portfolio, generally an index fund or a mix of index funds, and is satisfied with returns that simply _match_ the market as a whole as opposed to trying to beat the market. A passive investor normally spends little to no time maintaining their portfolio and doesn't attempt to time the market. You decide early on which index funds you want to invest in, and then you just buy them and hold them for the long term. 

The main downside of passive investing is that you aren't going to beat the market. You won't be making any crazy returns, but you also won't be taking the risk that you'll be underperforming the market. And as we saw from the last section, that's a relatively high risk, especially long term.
