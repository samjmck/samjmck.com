Recall that in the previous post, I wrote about the different types of securities. More specifically, I wrote about **mutual funds** as well as **exchange traded funds (ETFs)**. In the first section of this post, it should become clear why ETFs are so important for minimising the amount you pay in fees as well as taxes.

The remaining sections of the post are purely informative. They are useful if you want to understand how these funds minimise taxes and what determines the transaction tax, but they are not exactly necessary to get started with investing.

## The importance of ETFs

There are two problems with mutual funds:

1. **Most are actively managed**, meaning that the fund manager handpicks which securities to include in the fund. You might think that this isn't an issue as it's the fund manager's job to research the securities and that they should be able to pick securities that perform well. However, [research shows](https://web.archive.org/web/20211009152114/https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf "Report on active vs passive funds") that the vast majority of mutual funds aren't able to consistently beat or even meet their benchmarks indices, meaning that you would be better off simply holding all the stocks that are in an index instead of handpicking them.

2. **They are expensive**. The fees that mutual funds charge are almost always higher than ETFs. For example, if you look at [KBC's mutual funds](https://www.kbc.be/corporate/en/product/investments/fund-finder.html "KBC fund finder"), you'll notice that many of their funds charge 2-3% per year in fees.

ETFs conveniently solve these two problems:

1. Remember how I said you would be better off buying the stocks in an index? This is precisely what index funds do: **they simply hold the stocks that are in an index**.

2. **Index funds can be very cheap.** As index funds aren't actively managed like many normal funds, they also have less fees. And the larger a fund becomes, the less they need to charge.

> Remember that an index fund is a type of ETF. There are more actively managed ETFs that do not track an index, but all ETFs I'll be writing about are index funds that are passively managed.

For example, [one of the largest index funds in Europe](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4L5Y983#overview "iShares MSCI World ETF") charges just 0,20% per year in fees. In the previous post, I talked about how diversification is also important. This index fund has exposure to over 1500 stocks, which means it is highly diversified. Lastly, the only tax you pay on this is a transaction tax: 0,12% when you buy it and 0,12% when you sell it.

The ETF I just talked about is also a great example of how holding just one ETF can help you create a highly diversified portfolio. That ETF is also very tax-efficient in Belgium for 3 reasons:

1. It is domiciled in Ireland and Ireland has favourable tax treaties with most countries, including the US where most stocks are based. This means that the fund is able to minimise the amount of money paid in taxes when one if its stocks pays a dividend.

2. The ETF is not registered in Belgium but is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). This is good for us as Belgian-registered funds acutally have a higher transaction tax rate of 1,32%, whereas funds that are [not registered in Belgium]((https://web.archive.org/web/20211009152140/https://www.fsma.be/sites/default/files/legacy/ccp2_li_nl.pdf "List of foreign funds registered with the Belgian FSMA") but are registed in the EEA get taxed at a much lower rate of 0,12%.

3. The fund is accumulating, which means that dividends paid out by underlying stocks of the fund are reinvested back into the fund instead of paid out to us. This way, we can avoid any withholding taxes that we would normally have to pay on dividends.

## Stock market related taxes in Belgium

I touched on this briefly at the start of the previous post: Belgium is a surprisingly good country when it comes to stock market related taxes. There is **no capital gains** tax as long as your investments fall under your general wealth management and are deemed not speculative by tax authorities. What is deemed speculative or not is up to debate, and I talk more about that [here](#extra--speculation-tax), but in general, the investing I will be talking about is not speculative.

There is, however, a **taks op beursverrichtingen** (TOB) which translates to tax on stock exchange transactions. You'll have to pay this tax whenever you buy and sell a security on a stock exchange. All Belgian brokers pay this tax for you automatically. The TOB rate ranges from 0,12% to 1,32%. There is also a 30% withholding tax on dividends received from stocks or funds.

## Transaction tax (TOB)

The TOB is normally the only tax you will have to pay when investing in the stock market. You have to pay it when you purchase or sell certain types of securities. And if you are investing through a Belgian broker or bank, they will calculate, pay and declare the tax for you. Doing those things manually can be quite time-consuming, which is why it is recommended to use a broker that does it for you.

The detailed list of which TOB rates apply to what securities can be found on the website of the [tax authorities](https://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/myminfin-web/pages/fisconet/document/07143c83-8ef9-4d85-a5fd-7564b0393e1b "Transaction tax rates"). Here's a summary of the most important rates:
- 0,35% for shares of stocks
- 0,12% for bonds
- 0,12% for distributing ETFs that are registered in Belgium
- 1,32% for accumulating ETFs that are registered in Belgium
- **0,12% for ETFs that are not registered in Belgium but are registered in the European Economic Area**

The last 3 rates are the most important:
- The **0,12%** TOB for Belgian registered distributing ETFs is low but unfortunately, as I will explain in the next section, dividends are taxed, and distributing ETFs pay out dividends to investors. It would be better to invest in accumulating ETFs that reinvest dividends internally without paying out the dividends, as we could then avoid the dividend tax.
- The problem is that Belgian registered accumulating ETFs are taxed at **1,32%**, which is a fair bit more than the 0,12% of distributing ETFs.
- Luckily, there's no benefit to buying ETFs that are registered in Belgium, and foreign funds that are still registered in the European Economic Area are taxed at a low rate of **0,12%**. These can also be accumulating to avoid the dividend tax. Towards the end of this post, you'll notice that we mostly focus on foreign - or more specific, Ireland domiciled - funds. This is one of the reasons why, as Ireland is in the European Economic Area and most funds domiciled there aren't registered here.

> Funds registered in Belgium are [registered with the FSMA](https://www.fsma.be/sites/default/files/legacy/ccp2_li_nl.pdf "Belgium registered funds") (Financial Services and Markets Authority). Note that a fund being registered does not make it more or less trustworthy than funds that aren't registered; it just means that the provider of the fund is allowed to partake in certain commercial activities like advertising the fund to Belgian investors. This does also not mean that you cannot buy non-registered funds in Belgium.

## Withholding tax

There's a 30% withholding tax or roerende voorheffing on dividends paid out by shares and interests received by bonds. If a Belgian company or fund is paying out the dividends, then they will pay the withholding tax for you. If the dividends are coming from a foreign company or fund, then your broker or bank will pay the withholding tax for you. This tax can be avoided quite easily when investing in ETFs by simply choosing an accumulating ETF, but it's still important to understand what the withholding tax is as the dividends received by the fund internally will still be taxed by other countries.

To understand what happens with dividends when you invest in an ETF, I will first explain what happens when you invest in a foreign stock. Take Apple for instance: when they pay out dividends to Belgian investors, the US would normally impose a 30% withholding tax on the dividends and then there would also be the 30% withholding tax from Belgium before it finally reaches the Belgian investor. This would leave us with a mere 49% of the original dividend. Luckily, there is a [US - Belgium double tax treaty](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/belgiumtt06.pdf "US Belgium double tax treaty") which reduces the withholding tax of the US to 15%, but that still leaves us with only 59,5% of the original dividend.

When you invest in an ETF, the situation gets even more complicated. There are now multiple levels of taxation:
1. The first level of taxation is at the **source** of the dividends. Like the example I just gave, dividends paid out by Apple to foreign investors would have a US withholding tax as they are a US corporation. The same goes for other foreign stocks: Dutch stocks will have a Dutch withholding tax, German stocks with have a German withholding tax and so on.
2. The second level is at the **ETF's country of domicile**. This is very important when it comes to reducing withholding taxes: the double tax treaties of the fund's domicile country will determine what percentage of the dividends you will be able to keep. This is also the reason why so many ETFs are domiciled in Ireland, because Ireland has a tax treaty with the US which reduces the withholding tax on the US side to 15% and Ireland itself does not tax dividends at all. Ireland also has favourable tax treaties with most countries.
3. The third and last level of taxation is the **Belgian withholding tax** when the dividends get paid out to you. As mentioned before, you can avoid this withholding tax by opting for an accumulating ETF instead of a distributing ETF.

Lastly, there is also a 30% withholding tax on any capital gains made from selling bonds. If you're investing in a fund that holds bonds, then the tax is applicable on the bonds part of the fund only if bonds make up 10% or more of the fund's portfolio. Ultimately, even though bonds are a good way to diversify a portfolio, the withholding taxes on their capital gains and coupons make them fairly useless, which is also why I won't be discussing them any further.

## Recap: what you should look for

When looking for an ETF, you should look for one that is accumulating so that you aren't directly paid any dividends and you can avoid the Belgian withholding tax. The fact that the dividends get reinvested into the ETF make the shares of the ETF more valuable, which means you will be able to sell them for more money. The ETF should also be domiciled in a country that has favourable tax treaties with the countries where most of its holdings are based. Most ETFs are domiciled in Ireland though, so that shouldn't be an issue.

## Extra: speculation tax

The gains of any kind of investing that is considered "responsible" by the tax authorities will not be taxed. This includes normal management of your stock portfolio, so buying and selling shares of funds and stocks when you would like to invest some money or take some out. If the tax authorities feel like you're buying and selling more frequently than you should be or that you're trading with margin (borrowed money) or investing in risky products, then what you're doing might be considered as speculation. The burden is on the tax authorities to collect evidence to show that you were actually speculating. If they succeed, then you'll have to pay a "divers inkomen" (miscellaneous income) tax of 33% on the profits you made from those activities. In reality, this is something that you shouldn't worry about unless you're investing as a day job or doing it professionally.
