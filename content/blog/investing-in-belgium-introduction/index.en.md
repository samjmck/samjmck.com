This is the first post of a series in which I cover how to invest in the stock market in Belgium. All the posts together act as an extensive guide on how to start investing: I cover everything from the definition of a stock to placing your first order with a broker.

In this introduction, I explain the following:  
- why people invest in the stock market and what other investments are popular  
- what the different types of securities are  
- basic taxes on securities

If you would like to skip ahead, you can use the table of contents to do so.

## Investments and the stock market

...

1. Investing in the stock market is accessible
All you need to get started is an account with a broker and some money. If you choose a Belgian broker, they'll also pay your taxes for you. The only middleman you have to deal with is your broker.

It's also accessible in the sense that it's very easy to learn about the stock market and investing. There are countless podcasts, books, blog posts and videos which can help you better understand what's actually happening with your money.

2. In Belgium, there's no capital gains tax
This means that when you sell your securities, you won't be taxed on the profits you've made. There are a few exceptions to this rule but generally speaking, unless you're investing as a day job, you won't have to pay any capital gains tax. This makes the stock market very attractive to investors.

3. It's low maintenance
Depending on your investment strategy, you can buy a security and hold onto it for a long time without having to put any extra time into it. The same cannot be said for investments like real estate where you have to main the property, deal with tenants and ultimately invest much more time than you would in a portfolio for the stock market.

Some basic terminology:


## Types of securities

Put simply, a security is some kind of contract that has a monetary value and can be easily traded with other people. In general, this includes shares, bonds, currency futures and so on. The exact definition and list of products depends on the regulator or organisation. These securities can be traded through different kinds of exchanges, like a stock exchange. Notable examples of stock exchanges are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Euronext which includes the Euronext Brussels. 

In Belgium, an account that holds securities is called an _effectenrekening_ (or securities account). This is the same as a brokerage account.

### Shares

When you own a share, you own a percentage of a stock. A stock represents the ownership of a company. Some stocks pay dividends, which are shares of the profits of the company. The market worth of a company can be determined by multiplying the number of available shares by the price of one share. This is also called the market capitalisation (or market cap) of a company. For example, if BMW's share price is 70 euros and there are 1 billion issued shares, then their market cap is 70 euros x 1 billion = 70 billion euros.

### Bonds

https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/what-is-a-bond

A bond is an obligation from a party, mostly governments or companies, that you'll be paid an interest rate that was agreed on. You're effectively loaning money to the organisation that you buy the bond from. As long as you hold the bond, you will collect interest. Is it also possible to sell bonds, at which point the price gets determined by the likelihood that the party will pay their interest on time. That value could be more or less than what you initially paid for it.

Bonds can play a vital role in the risk _diversification_ of a portfolio. They are low risk, but they also have low interest rates.

Definition of **diversification** as per investor.gov:
"One of the most important ways to lessen the risks of investing is to diversify your investments. It's common sense: don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you buy a mix of different types of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, your overall holdings will not be wiped out if one investment fails. If you had just one investment and it went down in value, then you would lose money. But if you had ten different investments and one went down in value, you could still come out ahead."

### Derivatives

https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl/beleggen/financiele-termen.html#a

A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from the value of the underlying asset. They can be used for hedging, which reduces the risk of a certain position, or they can be used to take on more risk. 

An example of a derivative is a contract for difference or CFD. The difference between the underlying asset's value at the purchase and sell time of the contract gets paid to the buyer. You can purchase a long CFD, which means you will profit if the underlying asset increases or value, or a short CFD, which means you profit when the underlying asset decreases in value. Most brokers offer CFDs as a leveraged product, meaning you can gain more exposure to the risks of the asset without having to pay the full price. 

Say your broker offers CFDs with a 1:10 leverage and you think Microsoft shares, which are currently valued at $100, are going to go up in value. Because you have 1:10 leverage, you can purchase a CFD for 10 shares for $100 instead of the $1000 it would cost to buy the 10 shares outright. There's are a few things to note:

1. Not only will your profit be multiplied by a factor of 10, your losses will be as well.
2. You aren't actually holding the underlying shares, which might have implications on your taxes. More on this in the next post.
3. In some circumstances, using CFDs might be considered speculation by the tax authorities. Again, more on this in the next post.

### Mutual funds and hedge funds

https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/sec-guide-to-mutual-funds.pdf

The SEC has a very clear definition of what a mutual fund is:

> A mutual fund is an investment company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments. The combined securities and assets the mutual fund owns are known as its portfolio. Each mutual fund share represents an investor’s proportionate ownership of the mutual fund’s portfolio and the income the portfolio generates. Investors in mutual funds buy their shares from, and sell/redeem their shares to, the mutual funds themselves.

That last sentence is important: you can only sell and purchase shares of a mutual fund through the mutual fund itself. 

Mutual funds, or funds in general, are one of the most popular ways to invest in the stock market as they offer an easy route to diversification: the fund could contain hundreds of different stocks or assets which are chosen by the fund manager.

### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

https://dfi.wa.gov/financial-education/information/etfs
https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/etf-vs-mutual-fund
https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/ETFs_vs_mutual_funds

Like mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) can invest in a number of different financial products. A share in the fund is an investment in the portfolio of the fund, which is the basket of securities that the ETF holds. The main difference between mutual funds and ETFs is that ETFs are traded on a normal stock exchange, meaning you can sell or purchase them as you would normal shares.
