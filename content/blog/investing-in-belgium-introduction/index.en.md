This is the first post of a series in which I cover how to invest _in the stock market_ in Belgium. All the posts together act as an extensive guide on how to start investing: I cover everything from the definition of a stock to placing your first order with a broker.  

In this introduction, I explain the following:  
- why people invest in the stock market and what other investments are popular  
- what the different types of securities are  
- basic taxes on securities
