Belgium is an interesting country when it comes to investing in the stock market. We have some of the highest income taxes in the world yet we also have some of the lowest stock market taxes, including no tax your profits if you invest correctly.

This blog series is not meant to be a guide on how to make money. It is meant to explain how you can get started investing in the stock market, **specifically as a Belgian**. I'll talk about the most relevant tax laws and what you can do about them as well as what the different investment platforms are and how to choose one. And lastly, while I'm not aiming to teach you how to make as much money as possible, I will explain the differences between active and passive investing and how passive investing works with Belgian taxes.

If you already have experience investing, you can use the table of contents below to jump to the part that interests you the most. If you're new to investing, then this post is a good starting point.

## Investments and the stock market

There are many ways to invest your money. Real estate, gold, wine, stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, you name it. Some of these investments are probably worse than others. Using the stock market is one of the most common ways to invest. And for good reason:
- **It's easy to get started and to maintain.** The only thing you need is an account with a broker or bank and some money to get started. Unlike with real estate, you don't _have_ to constantly maintain your brokerage account. It's perfectly possible to just buy a something and then forget about it for years.
- **There is no capital gains tax in Belgium, which means you don't pay taxes on your profits.** There's some context to this which I'll explain in the next blog post. However, in general, this statement holds true.
- **There's no easier way to diversify your investments.** Diversification means that you spread your investments with the aim of reducing risk. Spreading your investments in the stock market is easy: you can buy shares of different companies, different industries and even different countries.

There are many more reasons why investing in the stock market is a good idea, but I'll leave it at that for now. The rest of this post will mostly be about the different terminology that is used in the stock market. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but you can always come back to this post if you're confused about something. I will translate certain terms to Dutch by writing them in parenthesis

## Basic terminology

A brokerage account (**effectenrekening**) is an account that holds all your stock market investments. You can normally open one of these accounts with your bank or a broker, more on this in the second blog post. Popular brokers are Bolero (KBC), BNP Paribas Fortis, Binck Bank and any major bank.

A security (**effect**) is a financial product that has monetary value and can be easily traded with other people on a stock exchange. Shares of stocks are the most common type of security.

An **index** is a number that tracks the performance of a certain group of stocks. When you watch financial news, you'll notice that certain indices are always shown as they can be used to gauage how well a part of the stock market is performing. For example, the S&P 500 is one of the most well-known indices that tracks the 500 largest companies that are listed on American stock exchanges. Similarly, the BEL 20 index tracks the the 20 largest companies listed on the Belgian stock market and the FTSE 100 tracks companies listed on the British stock market. The larger the company, the more its share price will affect the index number.

A **portfolio** is a list of your investments.

**Active investing** is when you are actively researching which companies or industries to invest in. **Passive investing** is when you decide on a strategy early on, invest your money and then leave your portfolio alone to let it grow.

## Types of securities

Put simply, a **security** is some kind of financial product that has monetary value and can be easily traded with other people. For example, having shares in a stock means that you own part of the stock or company. These shares are worth money on the stock market and you can sell them to other people.

A **stock exchange** is a particular market where you can sell your shares. Notable stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the Nasdaq and so on. Our local stock exchange is the Euronext Brussels. Many brokers give you access to all of the above as well as other major exchanges.

Now, let's take a look at some of the most common types of securities. If you don't know much about investing, then securities such as **Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)** might be new to you.

### Shares of stocks

When you own a **share**, you own a percentage of a stock. A **stock** represents the ownership of a company. Some stocks pay _dividends_, which is a piece of the profits of the company. The market value of a company can be determined by multiplying the number of available shares by the price of one share. This is also called the _market capitalisation_ of a company. For example, if BMW's share price is 70 euros and there are 1 billion issued shares, then their market cap is 70 euros x 1 billion = 70 billion euros.

### Mutual funds

The _Securities and Exchange Commission_ (SEC) in the US has a very clear definition of what a mutual fund is:

> A mutual fund is an investment company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments. The combined securities and assets the mutual fund owns are known as its portfolio. Each mutual fund share represents an investor’s proportionate ownership of the mutual fund’s portfolio and the income the portfolio generates. **Investors in mutual funds buy their shares from, and sell/redeem their shares to, the mutual funds themselves, not through a exchange.**

That last sentence is important: you can only sell and purchase shares of a mutual fund through the mutual fund itself. 

**Mutual funds**, or funds in general, are one of the most popular ways to invest in the stock market as they offer an easy route to _diversification_: a fund can contain hundreds of different stocks or securities which are chosen by the fund manager. In addition to them being an easy way to diversify and not having to manage hundreds of stocks yourself, they are popular products among banks as they charge fees for investing in the fund.

{{< definition word="diversification" url="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/information/youth/teachers-classroom-resources/what-diversification" title="Diversification definition from US government investor website" source="investor.gov" >}}
One of the most important ways to lessen the risks of investing is to diversify your investments. It's common sense: don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you buy a mix of different types of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, your overall holdings will not be wiped out if one investment fails. If you had just one investment and it went down in value, then you would lose money. But if you had ten different investments and one went down in value, you could still come out ahead.

An example of a mutual fund is the _[Global Technology Fund](https://web.archive.org/web/20211009152710/https://www.troweprice.com/financial-intermediary/us/en/investments/mutual-funds/us-products/global-technology-fund.html "Global Technology Fund from T. Rowe Price")_ from T. Rowe Price, an American investment firm. The fund holds 60 tech stocks which are picked by the fund manager Alan Tu. If you scroll down on the information page, you'll see it requires an initial investment of at least 2500 USD and has a 0,85% fees per year.

### Exchange traded funds (ETFs)

Like mutual funds, **exchange traded funds (ETFs)** can contain a number of different securities. A share in the fund is an investment in the portfolio of the fund, which is the basket of securities that the ETF holds. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are traded on a normal stock exchange, which means you can buy and sell them like you would any other stock. This just makes it easier to buy and sell them. In the next section, I explain the importance of ETFs in a tax-efficient portfolio.

**Index funds** are a type of fund or ETF that simply track an index such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI World. Many ETFs are index funds which adhere to a passive investment strategy. These are very popular among investors.

An example of an ETF is the [iShares MSCI World](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4L5Y983#overview "iShares MSCI World ETF"). The MSCI World index contains over 1500 stocks from developed countries, so this index fund from iShares simply replicates the performance of the index by investing into those stocks.

### Bonds

A bond is an obligation from a party, mostly governments or companies, that you'll be paid an interest rate that was agreed on. You're effectively loaning money to the organisation that you buy the bond from. When you hit the bond's maturity date, you get your money back. In the meantime, you will have collected money in the form of coupons. It is also possibly to sell your bond before its maturity date.

Bonds can play a vital role in the risk diversification of a portfolio. Most bonds are low risk, but they also have low interest rates. In Belgium, they aren't very popular as their profits are taxed at 30%.

## Stock market related taxes in Belgium

Despite the high income taxes in Belgium, there are very few taxes when it comes to investing in the stock market. Most importantly, there is no capital gains tax. A capital gains tax is the tax you pay on the profit you make when selling an asset. 

There is, however, a **taks op beursverrichtingen** (TOB) which translates to tax on stock exchange transactions. You'll have to pay this tax whenever you buy and sell a security on a stock exchange. All Belgian brokers pay this tax for you automatically. The TOB rate ranges from 0,12% to 1,32%. There is also a 30% witholding tax on dividends received from stocks or funds.

In the next post, I will show you how to take advantage of the lowest TOB rate (0,12%) as well as how to avoid the withholding tax by choosing specific funds.

And when compared with real estate, it's clear that the stock market is incredibly cheap to invest in. When investing in real estate, you need to pay a registration tax as well as an annual property tax. There are also a lot of costs for real estate that are not related to taxes, such as time spent dealing with tenants, insurance and maintenance. 

## Extra: derivatives

A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from the value of the underlying asset. They can be used for hedging, which reduces the risk of a certain position, or they can be used to take on more risk.

An example of a derivative is a contract for difference or CFD. The difference between the underlying asset's value at the purchase and sell time of the contract gets paid to the buyer. You can purchase a long CFD, which means you will profit if the underlying asset increases or value, or a short CFD, which means you profit when the underlying asset decreases in value. Most brokers offer CFDs as a leveraged product, meaning you can gain more exposure to the risks of the asset without having to pay the full price.

Say your broker offers CFDs with a 1:10 leverage and you think Microsoft shares, which are currently valued at $100, are going to go up in value. Because you have 1:10 leverage, you can purchase a CFD for 10 shares for $100 instead of the $1000 it would cost to buy the 10 shares outright. There's are a few things to note:

1. Not only will your profit be multiplied by a factor of 10, your losses will be as well.
2. You aren't actually holding the underlying shares, which might have implications on your taxes. More on this in the next post.
3. In some circumstances, using CFDs might be considered speculation by the tax authorities. Again, more on this in the next post.
