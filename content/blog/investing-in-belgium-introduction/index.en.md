## Investments and the stock market

There are many ways to invest your money, but the stock market is probably one of the easiest and most effective ways to invest. Easy because you only need an account with a broker and some money to get started, and effective because there are very few taxes and other costs involved.

These blog posts will also teach you how to choose an investment strategy that is very low maintenance and won't require more than a few minutes of work per month once you get started, as opposed to real estate which requires constant maintenance and dealing with tenants.

## Basic terminology

An **effectenrekening** or brokerage account is an account that holds all your investments in the stock market, also known as _securities_. You can normally open one of these accounts with your bank or a broker, more on this in the second blog post. Popular brokers are Bolero (KBC), BNP Paribas Fortis, Binck Bank and any major bank.

An **index** is a number that tracks the performance of a certain group of stocks. When you watch financial news, you'll notice that certain indices are always shown as they can be used to gauage how well a part of the stock market is performing. For example, the S&P 500 is one of the most well-known indices that tracks 500 of the largest companies that are listed on American stock exchanges. Similarly, the BEL 20 index tracks the 20 of the largest companies listed on the Belgian stock market and the FTSE 100 tracks companies listed on the British stock market. The larger the company, the more its share price will affect the index number.

A **portfolio** is a list of your investments.

**Active investing** is when you are actively researching which companies or industries to invest in and when you hand pick stocks for your portfolio based on that research. **Passive investing** is when you decide on a strategy early on, invest your money and then basically leave your portfolio alone and let it grow.

## Types of securities

Put simply, a security is some kind of product that has a monetary value and can be easily traded with other people. For example, having shares in a stock means that you own part of the stock or company. 

You can easily sell these shares to a buyer on a stock exchange if you aren't interested in owning them anymore. Notable stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (DAX) and so on. Our local stock exchange is the Euronext Brussels. Many brokers give you access to all of the above as well as other major exchanges. 

Some securities are also traded on multiple exchanges. For example, you can trade Apple shares in Vienna or Milan.

The exact definition of a security depends on the regulator or organisation, but the specifics won't really matter unless you're getting involved in complicated taxes. In general, securities include shares, bonds, currency futures and other tradable products on an exchange. 

### Shares of stocks

When you own a share, you own a percentage of a stock. A stock represents the ownership of a company. Some stocks pay **dividends**, which is a piece of the profits of the company. The market worth of a company can be determined by multiplying the number of available shares by the price of one share. This is also called the **market capitalisation** (or market cap) of a company. For example, if BMW's share price is 70 euros and there are 1 billion issued shares, then their market cap is 70 euros x 1 billion = 70 billion euros.

### Mutual funds

The _Securities and Exchange Commission_ (SEC) in the US has a very clear definition of what a mutual fund is:

> A mutual fund is an investment company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments. The combined securities and assets the mutual fund owns are known as its portfolio. Each mutual fund share represents an investor’s proportionate ownership of the mutual fund’s portfolio and the income the portfolio generates. Investors in mutual funds buy their shares from, and sell/redeem their shares to, the mutual funds themselves, not through a exchange.

That last sentence is important: you can only sell and purchase shares of a mutual fund through the mutual fund itself. 

Mutual funds, or funds in general, are one of the most popular ways to invest in the stock market as they offer an easy route to **diversification**: the fund could contain hundreds of different stocks or securities which are chosen by the fund manager. In addition to them being an easy way to diversify and not having to manage hundreds of stocks yourself, they are popular products among banks as they charge fees for investing in the fund. 

{{< definition word="diversification" url="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/information/youth/teachers-classroom-resources/what-diversification" title="Diversification definition from US government investor website" source="investor.gov" >}}
One of the most important ways to lessen the risks of investing is to diversify your investments. It's common sense: don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you buy a mix of different types of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, your overall holdings will not be wiped out if one investment fails. If you had just one investment and it went down in value, then you would lose money. But if you had ten different investments and one went down in value, you could still come out ahead.

An example of a mutual fund is the _[Global Technology Fund](https://www.troweprice.com/financial-intermediary/us/en/investments/mutual-funds/us-products/global-technology-fund.html "Global Technology Fund from T. Rowe Price")_ from T. Rowe Price, an American investment firm. The fund holds 60 tech stocks which are picked by the fund manager Alan Tu. If you scroll down on the information page, you'll see it requires an initial investment of at least 2500 USD and has a 0,85% fees per year.

### Exchange traded funds (ETFs)

Like mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) can contain a number of different securities. A share in the fund is an investment in the portfolio of the fund, which is the basket of securities that the ETF holds. The main difference between mutual funds and ETFs is that ETFs are traded on a normal stock exchange, meaning you can sell or purchase them as you would normal shares. This is also an advantage over mutual funds, as you can buy shares of an ETF through any normal broker and won't have to communicate with your bank or investment firm. It also means you can sell or buy those shares like you would a normal stock.

**Accumulating ETFs** reinvest the dividends that the underlying securities payout back into the fund. This way, the shares of the ETF becomes more valuable and you will be able to sell the shares for a higher price.

**Distributing ETFs** pay out dividends to investors, meaning you can use the cash for something else or reinvest it into the ETF manually.

**Index funds** are a type of fund that simply track an index such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI World. Many ETFs are index funds which adhere to a passive investment strategy.

An example of an ETF is the [iShares MSCI World](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4L5Y983#overview "iShares MSCI World ETF"). The MSCI World index contains over 1500 stocks from developed countries, so this index fund from iShares simply replicates the performance of the index by investing into those stocks.

### Bonds

A bond is an obligation from a party, mostly governments or companies, that you'll be paid an interest rate that was agreed on. You're effectively loaning money to the organisation that you buy the bond from. When you hit the bond's maturity date, you get your money back. In the meantime, you will have collected interest. It is also possibly to sell your bond before its maturity date, at which point its value gets determined by a number of factors, such as current interest rates, the likelihood that the party will pay your interest and so on.

Bonds can play a vital role in the risk diversification of a portfolio. They are low risk, but they also have low interest rates. In Belgium, they aren't very popular as their profits are taxed at 30%.

## Stock market related taxes in Belgium

Despite the high income taxes in Belgium, there are very few taxes when it comes to investing in the stock market. Most importantly, there is no capital gains tax. A capital gains tax is the tax you pay on the profit you make when selling an asset. 

There is, however, a **taks op beursverrichtingen** (TOB) which literally means tax on stock exchange transactions. You'll have to pay this tax whenever you buy and sell a security on a stock exchange. All Belgian brokers pay this tax for you automatically. The TOB rate ranges from 0,12% to 1,32%. There is also a 30% witholding tax on dividends received from stocks or funds. 

In the next post, I will show you how to take advantage of the lowest TOB rate (0,12%) as well as how to avoid the withholding tax by choosing specific funds.

And when compared with real estate, it's clear that the stock market is incredibly cheap to invest in. When investing in real estate, you need to pay a registration tax as well as an annual property tax. There are also a lot of costs for real estate that are not related to taxes, such as time spent dealing with tenants, insurance and maintenance. 

## The importance of ETFs

There are two problems with mutual funds:

1. **Most are actively managed**, meaning that the fund manager handpicks which securities to include in the fund. You might think that this isn't an issue, as it's the fund manager's job to research the securities and they should be able to pick securities that perform well. However, [research shows](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf "Report on active vs passive funds") that the vast majority of mutual funds aren't able to consistently beat or even meet their benchmarks, meaning that you would be better off simply holding all the stocks that are in an index instead of handpicking them (which would be _passive investing_). 

2. **They are expensive**. The fees that mutual funds charge are almost always higher than ETFs. For example, if you look at [KBC's mutual funds](https://www.kbc.be/corporate/en/product/investments/fund-finder.html "KBC fund finder"), you'll notice that many of their funds charge 2-3% per year in fees. Meanwhile, [one of the largest ETFs in Europe](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4L5Y983#overview "iShares MSCI World ETF") charges just 0,20% per year in fees. 

So actively managed mutual funds are long-term very unlikely to outperform a passive ETF and they also charge higher fees. These are the main reasons why it is preferable to choose an ETF over a mutual fund. ETFs are also easier to trade, as you can simply buy and sell them on a stock exchange.

The ETF I just talked about is also a great example of how holding just one ETF can help you create a highly diversified portfolio. With that ETF, your portfolio can gain exposure to over 1500 stocks by holding just one security. 

That same ETF I just mentioned is also very tax-efficient in Belgium for 2 reasons:

1. It is domiciled in Ireland and Ireland has favourable tax treaties with most countries, including the US where most stocks are based. This means that the fund is able to minimise the amount of money paid in taxes when one if its stocks pays a dividend. And the lowest transaction tax rate of 0,12% that I mentioned in the previous section is applicable to this ETF, since it is [not registered in Belgium](https://www.fsma.be/sites/default/files/legacy/ccp2_li_nl.pdf "List of foreign funds registered with the Belgian FSMA") and Ireland is part of the European Economic Area.

2. The fund is accumulating, which means that dividends paid out by underlying stocks of the fund are reinvested back into the fund instead of paid out to us. This way, we can avoid any withholding taxes that we would normally have to pay on dividends.

I will talk about these points in more detail in the next blog post.

## Extra: derivatives

A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from the value of the underlying asset. They can be used for hedging, which reduces the risk of a certain position, or they can be used to take on more risk.

An example of a derivative is a contract for difference or CFD. The difference between the underlying asset's value at the purchase and sell time of the contract gets paid to the buyer. You can purchase a long CFD, which means you will profit if the underlying asset increases or value, or a short CFD, which means you profit when the underlying asset decreases in value. Most brokers offer CFDs as a leveraged product, meaning you can gain more exposure to the risks of the asset without having to pay the full price.

Say your broker offers CFDs with a 1:10 leverage and you think Microsoft shares, which are currently valued at $100, are going to go up in value. Because you have 1:10 leverage, you can purchase a CFD for 10 shares for $100 instead of the $1000 it would cost to buy the 10 shares outright. There's are a few things to note:

1. Not only will your profit be multiplied by a factor of 10, your losses will be as well.
2. You aren't actually holding the underlying shares, which might have implications on your taxes. More on this in the next post.
3. In some circumstances, using CFDs might be considered speculation by the tax authorities. Again, more on this in the next post.
