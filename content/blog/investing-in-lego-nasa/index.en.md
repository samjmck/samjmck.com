In 2019, my brother Max bought the [LEGO NASA Apollo Saturn V](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-nasa-apollo-saturn-v-92176). It's a very impressive 1:110 scale of the Saturn V rocket that brought the Apollo astronauts to the moon. While I appreciated the detail and size of the model, I wasn't really interested in buying one for myself. That was until Max told me that LEGO was planning to retire the set in later that year.

I can't remember whether LEGO actually announced they were going to retire the set officially. Looking at blog posts from around that time, it seems like the news was [published by an online LEGO magazine](https://www.brickfanatics.com/full-list-of-lego-sets-retiring-in-2019). Although it also seems like LEGO themselves have a [list of sets that are retiring soon](https://www.lego.com/en-be/categories/last-chance-to-buy). Regardless, I saw this as an investment opportunity. I had already heard about LEGO sets such as the original Star Wars Millennium Falcon being worth a fortune on the second-hand market. That set apparently retailed for around 440 euros. Now, 23 years after its retirement, it's worth around 2500 euros. There's an interesting website called [BrickEconomy](https://www.brickeconomy.com/set/10179-1/lego-star-wars-ultimate-collectors-millennium-falcon) which tracks the value of LEGO sets over time.

To put that into perspective, an investment of 440 euros in an accumulating ETF of the S&P 500 for the same time period would be worth 2670 euros today. You can see a backtest of that ETF [here](https://curvo.eu/backtest/portfolio/s-p-500--NoIgygZACgBArABgSANMUBJAokgQgZgA1CAlKBATlQEYBdeoA?config=%7B%22investmentPatterns%22%3A%5B%5B%22one-off%22%2C440%5D%5D%2C%22periodStart%22%3A%222010-05%22%7D).
