Typography is more than just what fonts you use. Typography is everything that has to do with how text looks – such as font size, line length, color, and even more subtle things like the whitespace around a text. Good typography sets the tone of your written message and helps to reinforce its meaning and context.

This is a handbook on best typographic practices through the lens of a web designer. It is meant to be short and concise – used as a reference rather than explanatory. For in-depth explanations and details, look at the links in the Further Readings of each section instead.

Lastly, this handbook is open source on GitHub and will continuously be updated with the best practices. Enjoy.
