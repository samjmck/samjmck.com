# Hugo has been configured to generate static files for the en and nl languages in the folders en and nl
# Now, the index.html at the root of the site which would normally redirect the client to /en/ will proxy
#Â the request. This is much faster for the client and provides a better experience
# It also proxies to the correct lang site
